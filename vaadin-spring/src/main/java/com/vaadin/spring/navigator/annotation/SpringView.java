/**
 * Annotation to be placed on {@link com.vaadin.navigator.View}-classes that
 * should be handled by the {@link SpringViewProvider}.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is also a stereotype annotation, so Spring will automatically
 * detect the annotated classes. <b>However, the scope must be explicitly
 * specified as the default singleton scope will not work!</b> You can use the
 * {@code prototype} scope or the
 * {@link com.vaadin.spring.annotation.VaadinUIScope ui} scope.
 * <p>
 * This is an example of a view that is mapped to an empty view name and is
 * available for all UI subclasses in the application:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;SpringView(name = &quot;&quot;)
 * &#064;UIScope
 * public class MyDefaultView extends CustomComponent implements View {
 *     // ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This is an example of a view that is only available to a specified UI
 * subclass:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;SpringView(name = &quot;myView&quot;, ui = MyUI.class)
 * &#064;UIScope
 * public class MyView extends CustomComponent implements View {
 *     // ...
